New UI:
- Replace "create item" link with dialog that lets you create a new collection or select a file to upload using the standard file finding dialog.
- Show a placeholder item while an upload is in progress.
- Hook through upload progress percentage from the camli javascript API to the upload placeholder item.
- Fix smaller/larger magnify to clear all children before refectching recent list, otherwise it does this weird two-step resizing thing, where the thumbnails are too big for half a second.
- When a list of items is selected, have a toolbar option or button to add them into one of the collections; have that pop up a blob container that shows just container type blobs.
- Have a way to disable drag/drop on a blob item container and prevent uploads.
