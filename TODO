-- Get App Engine blob server up to parity (brett)

-- add CROS support?
   http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/cross-site-xmlhttprequest-with-cors/

-- Go: ditch our http Range header stuff, get in upstream Go

-- camput: support for skipping common cache/temp files

-- camget: finish.  it's barely started.  should be able to cat blobs
   or restore filesytems from backup.

-- fuse read/write support using search / camliMember, permanode per inode
   (https://github.com/hanwen/go-fuse + Go camlistore client == easy?)

-- brackup integration, perhaps sans GPG? (requires Perl client?)

-- blobserver test suite: flesh it out.  (bs-test.pl ... it's pretty good
   so far, but not done)
-- blobserver: clean up channel-closing consistency in blobserver interface
   (most close, one doesn't.  all should probably close)

Android:

[ ] Fix wake locks in UploadThread.  need to hold CPU + WiFi whenever
    something's enqueued at all and we're running.  Move out of the Thread
    that's uploading itself.
[ ] GPG signing of blobs (brad)
    http://code.google.com/p/android-privacy-guard/
    http://www.thialfihar.org/projects/apg/
    (supports signing in code, but not an Intent?)
