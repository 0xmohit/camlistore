The /camli/enumerate-blobs endpoint enumerates all blobs that the
server knows about.

They're returned in sorted order, sorted by (digest_type,
digest_value).  That is, md5-acbd18db4cc2f85cedef654fccc4a4d8 sorts
before sha1-0beec7b5ea3f0fdbc95d0dd47f3c5bc275da8a33 because "m" sorts
before "s", even though "0" sorts before "a".
