If connection drops during a POST to an upload URL, you should re-do a
preupload request to verify which objects were received by the server
and which were not.  Also, the URL you received from preupload before
might no longer work, so preupload is required to a get a valid upload
URL.

For information on resuming truncated uploads, read blob-upload-resume.txt
