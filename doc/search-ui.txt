The User Interface's "Search" box understands simple (no grouping)
boolean expressions of "operator:value" expressions stitched together with
"and" and "or" words, separated by spaces.

Negation is achieved by prepending a minus sign: -is:landscape will match
with pictures of not landscape ratio.

For example

    after:"2010-01-01" and before:"2010-03-02T12:33:44" or loc:"Amsterdam"

will return all images having "modtime" between before and after or having
location in Amsterdam.

Usable operators:
    after:         date format is RFC3339, but can be shortened as required.
    before:        i.e. 2011-01-01 is Jan 1 of year 2011 and "2011" means the same.
    format:        file's format (or MIME-type) such as jpg, pdf, tiff.
    has:location   image has a location (GPSLatitude and GPSLongitude can be
                   retrieved from the image's EXIF tags).
    loc:           loc:"new york, new york" or "loc:new york, new york" both work.
                   If specified, only images having a location near
                   the specified locations are matched.
                   Locations are resolved using maps.googleapis.com.
