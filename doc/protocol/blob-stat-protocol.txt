The 'stat' method is both a stat on the server itself (server
capability/property discovery), as well as a multi-stat() on blobs.

Notably: the HTTP method may be GET or POST.  GET is more correct but
be aware that HTTP servers and proxies start to suck around the 2k and
4k URL lengths.  If you're stat'ing more than ~37 blobs, using POST
would be safest.

In either case, the request form values: (either in the URL for GET or
application/x-www-form-urlencoded body for POST)


   camliversion    required   Version of camlistore and/or stat protocol;
                              reserved for future use.  Must be "1" for now.

   blob<n>         optional/  Must start at 1 and go up, no gaps allowed, not
                   repeated   zero-padded, etc.  Value is a blobref, e.g
                              "sha1-9b03f7aca1ac60d40b5e570c34f79a3e07c918e8"
                              There's no defined limit on how many you include here,
                              but servers may return a 400 Bad Request if you ask
                              for too many.  All servers should support <= 1000
                              though.

Examples:

GET /camli/stat?camliversion=1&blob1=sha1-9b03f7aca1ac60d40b5e570c34f79a3e07c918e8 HTTP/1.1

blob2=sha1-abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcd&
blob3=sha1-deadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef

Response keys:

   stat             required   Array of {"blobRef": BLOBREF, "size": INT_bytes}
                               for blobs that the system already has. Empty
                               list if no blobs are already present.
   maxUploadSize    required   Integer of max byte size for whole request
                               payload, which may be one or more blobs.
   uploadUrl        required   Next URL to use to upload any more blobs.
   uploadUrlExpirationSeconds
                    required   How long the upload URL will be valid for,
                               in seconds.
