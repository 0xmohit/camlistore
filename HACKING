Camlistore contributors regularly use Linux and OS X, and both are
100% supported.

Developing on Windows is sometimes broken, but should work.  Let us
know if we broke something, or we accidentally depend on some
Unix-specific build tool somewhere.

See http://camlistore.org/docs/contributing for information on how to
contribute to the project and submit patches.  Notably, we use Gerrit
for code review.  Our Gerrit instance is at https://camlistore.org/r/

See architecture docs: https://camlistore.org/docs/

You can view docs for Camlistore packages with local godoc, or
godoc.org.

It's recommended you use git to fetch the source code, rather than
hack from a Camlistore release's zip file:

$ git clone https://camlistore.org/r/p/camlistore

(We use github for distribution and collaboration with some people,
but the Gerrit git server & code review system is the main repo.)

On Debian/Ubuntu, some deps to get started:

$ sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 pkg-config git

Then we use the following scripts to run a hermetic, self-contained
environment independent (with its own config files & storage space):

$ ./dev-server
$ ./dev-camput
$ ./dev-camget
... etc.

e.g.
  - Upload a file (make sure this works):
      ~/camlistore/dev-camput file ~/camlistore/COPYING
  - Create a permanode:
      ~/camlistore/dev-camput permanode
  - Use the UI: http://localhost:3179/ui/

Please update this file as appropriate.
