<h1>Configuring the server</h1>

<p>The server's config file at $HOME/.camlistore/server-config.json is JSON. It can either be in simple mode (for basic configurations), or in low-level mode (for any sort of crazy configuration).</p>

<p>This page documents the simple configuration mode.</p>

<p>If you visit your Camlistore server's /setup page (by default, at
http://localhost:3179/setup) you can modify the config file from your
web browser and restart the server.</p>

<h1>Configuration Keys &amp; Values</h1>

<ul>
<li><b><code>auth</code></b>: the authentication mechanism to use. Example values include:
    <table cellpadding=4 border=1>
     <tr><td><code>none</code></td><td>No authentication.</td></tr>
     <tr><td><code>localhost</code></td><td>Accept connections coming from localhost. On Linux, this means connections from localhost that are also from the same user as the user running the server.</td></tr>
     <tr><td><code>userpass:alice:secret</code></td><td>HTTP basic authentication. Username "alice", password "secret". Only recommended if using HTTPS.</td></tr>
     <tr><td><code>userpass:alice:secret:+localhost</code></td><td>Same as above, but also accept localhost auth</td></tr>
     <tr><td><code>userpass:alice:secret:vivify=othersecret</code></td><td>Alice has password "secret", but her Android phone can use password "othersecret" to do a minimal set of operations (upload new things, but not access anything)r</td></tr>
    </table>

<li><b><code>baseURL</code></b>: Optional. If non-empty, this is the root of your URL prefix for your Camlistore server. Useful for when running behind a reverse proxy. Should not end in a slash. e.g. <code>https://yourserver.example.com</code></li>
<li><b><code>blobPath</code></b>: local disk path to store blobs. May be empty if some other storage option is specified.</li>
<li><b><code>https</code></b>: if "true", HTTPS is used</li>
<li><b><code>identity</code></b>: your GPG fingerprint. A keypair is created for new users on start, but this may be changed if you know what you're doing.</li>
<li><b><code>identitySecretRing</code></b>: your GnuPG secret keyring file. A new keyring is created on start for new users, but may be changed if you know what you're doing./li>
<li><b><code>listen</code></b>: The port (like "80" or ":80") or IP & port (like "10.0.0.2:8080") to listen for HTTP(s) connections on.</li>
<li><b><code>s3</code></b>: Either empty (to not use Amazon S3 for storage), or of form "key:secret:bucket" (with colons, but no quotes).
<li><b><code>shareHandler</code></b>: if "true", the server's sharing functionality is enabled, letting your friends have access to any content you've specifically shared.</li>
