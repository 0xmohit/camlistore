<h1>Terminology</h1>

<p>To stay sane and communicate effectively we try hard to use
consistent terminology throughout the pieces of the project.  Please let us know
if things here are confusing or lacking.</p>

<dl class='terms'>

<dt>blob</dt>
  <dd>an immutable sequence of 0 or more bytes, with no extra metadata</dd>

<dt>blobref</dt>
  <dd>a reference to a blob, consisting of a cryptographic hash
  function name and that hash function's digest of the blob's bytes,
  in hex.  Examples of valid blobrefs include:
  <pre>
     sha1-f1d2d2f924e986ac86fdf7b36c94bcdf32beec15
     md5-d3b07384d113edec49eaa6238ad5ff00
     sha256-b5bb9d8014a0f9b1d61e21e796d78dccdf1352f23cd32812f4850b878ae4944c</pre>
  Concatenating the two together with a hyphen is the common
  representation, with both parts in all lower case.
  </dd>

<dt>blob server</dt>
  <dd>the simplest and lowest layer of the Camlistore servers.  A blob server,
     while potentially shared between users, is <em>logically private to a single user</em>
     and holds that user's blobs (<a href="/docs/schema">whatever they may represent</a>).
