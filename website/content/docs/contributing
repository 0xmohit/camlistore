<h1>Contributing</h1>

<p>Want to contribute to the project?  Awesome!</p>

<ul class='lispaced'>
   <li>Join the <a href="/lists">mailing list</a>.  Say hi.</li>
   <li>Pick an area to tackle.  Discuss it first, especially if it's large and/or not well designed yet.</li>
   <li>Put your changes online somewhere for review &amp; git pulling.</li>
   <li>Note that you'll need to agree to the appropriate Contributor License Agreement:
       <ul>
          <li><a href="http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html">Individual Contributor License Agreement</a> (electronic signature okay) </li>
          <li><a href="http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html">Corporate Contributor License Agreement</a> (requires faxing or mailing)</li>
       </ul>
       (These make lawyers feel all warm and cozy about open source.)
   </li>

   <li>We'll submit your changes initially; but once you contribute
   good changes for awhile, we'll get you direct commit access.</li>

</ul>

<h1>Code Review</h1>
<ul class='lispaced'>
	<li>Camlistore requires changes to be reviewed before they are committed.</li>
	<li>Sign in to Gerrit at <a href="http://camlistore.org/r/">http://camlistore.org/r/</a> and set your username + SSH key(s).
            You'll want your Gerrit username to be the same as your local machine's $USER, else you'll need to modify the misc/review script.</li>
	<li>Usual Work Flow</li>
		<ul>
                        <li>Create a topic branch. Commit away. If you modify or squash your commits during review, don't touch <a href="http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.2.1/user-changeid.html">the Change-Id line</a>.</li>
                        <li>Send for review, with:<pre>./misc/review</pre> (assuming your Gerrit username is the same as your local machine's $USER)</li>
			<li>... (review, modify, git add [changed files], git commit --amend, running ./misc/review again during review, until change is merged) ... </li>
			<li>Finally, if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask the <a href='/lists'>mailing list</a> if you have questions.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Have Fun!</li>
</ul>
