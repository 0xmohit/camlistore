<p><b>TODO:</b> finish documenting this.</p>

<p>For now, see <a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/camlistore/browse_thread/thread/a4920d6a1c5fc3ce">this
thread</a> for some background.  The basic summary is that you create
a <a href="/docs/terms#claim">claim</a> that a user has access to
something, and then your blobserver's public frontend authenticates
(if applicable) a remote user and gives them access as permitted by
your claim.</p>
