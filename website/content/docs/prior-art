<h1>Prior Art & Related Projects</h1>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.livejournal.org/">LiveJournal</a>'s photo hosting, my first experiment with content-addressable storage, which led to:</li>
  <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/brackup/">Brackup</a>, my original content-addressable backup tool, but didn't store directories as the digest of their contents.  (so backup manifests were huge)</li>
  <li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, which exposed me to the idea of hashing directories, commits, etc.  But git probably got it from Venti / Fossil:</li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venti">Venti</a> / <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_(file_system)">Fossil</a>, apparently pioneered the idea of recursive content-addressable file systems.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.monotone.ca/">Monotone</a>'s "Certificates" are similar to Camli claims.</li>
</ul>

<p>Probably more, though.  Contributions to this list are welcome!</p>
